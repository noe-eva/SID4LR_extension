# Slot and Intent Detection for Low Resource language varieties (SID4LR): Dialect Extension

This repository contains the **dialect extension** to the xSID corpus by van der Goot et al. (NAACL 2021). The corpus was extended with **Neapolitan** and **Swiss German (Bernese)** dialect translations. With the extended corpus we created the shared task _Slot and Intent Detection for Low-Resource Language Varieties_ (SID4LR) which we organized as part of the _Natural Language Processing for Similar Language Varieties and Dialects_ (VarDial) workshop co-located with EACL 2023.

The shared task is available here: https://bitbucket.org/robvanderg/sid4lr/src/master/
