# Slot and Intent Detection for Low Resource language varieties (SID4LR): Dialect Extension

This repository contains the **dialect extension** to the xSID corpus by van der Goot et al. (NAACL 2021). The corpus was extended with **Neapolitan** and **Swiss German (Bernese)** dialect translations. With the extended corpus we created the shared task _Slot and Intent Detection for Low-Resource Language Varieties_ (SID4LR) which we organized as part of the _Natural Language Processing for Similar Language Varieties and Dialects_ (VarDial) workshop co-located with EACL 2023.

The shared task is available here: https://bitbucket.org/robvanderg/sid4lr/src/master/

Please cite this paper for the SID4LR shared task and for v4.0 of the xSID corpus.

The campaign is part of the tenth workshop on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects (VarDial), co-located with EACL 2023. Three separate shared tasks were included this year: Slot and intent detection for low-resource language varieties (SID4LR), Discriminating Between Similar Languages {--} True Labels (DSL-TL), and Discriminating Between Similar Languages {--} Speech (DSL-S). All three tasks were organized for the first time this year.",
